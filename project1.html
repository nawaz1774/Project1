						<li>The mean of ridership calculated for when it does not rain is higher than when it rains. So the general assumption would be that people prefer taking NYC Subway when it does not rain. This assumption formulates our Alternate Hypothesis.</li>	
						<li>In order to quantify our assumption a statistical test called Mann Whitney U was used.</li>
						<li>The Alpha value (p-critical) value has been chosen to be 0.05. Any p-value less than this, signifies that a particular incident did not happen by chance. There was some kind of intervention that caused these results.</li>
						<li>In this case we calculated the probability value to be  0.025 which is less than 0.05 (p-critical) which signifies that this difference in means of ridership when it rains to when it does not rain did not occur by chance rather occurred due some kind of intervention. In this case rain on that particular day.</li>

				<h2>Section 3 : Visualization</h2>

			<div class = "col-md-12 q30">
				<p>Please include two visualizations that show the relationships between two or more variables in the NYC subway data. You should feel free to implement something that we discussed in class (e.g., scatter plots, line plots, or histograms) or attempt to implement something more advanced if you'd like. Remember to add appropriate titles and axes labels to your plots. Also, please add a short description below each figure commenting on the key insights depicted in the figure.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Q3.1 -->
			<div class = "col-md-12 question3">
				<p class = "col-md-12 q31">3.1 One visualization should contain two histograms: one of  ENTRIESn_hourly for rainy days and one of ENTRIESn_hourly for non-rainy days.</p>
				<div class = "col-md-1"></div><p class = "col-md-11 q31">You can combine the two histograms in a single plot or you can use two separate plots. If you decide to use to two separate plots for the two histograms, please ensure that the x-axis limits for both of the plots are identical. It is much easier to compare the two in that case. For the histograms, you should have intervals representing the volume of ridership (value of ENTRIESn_hourly) on the x-axis and the frequency of occurrence on the y-axis. For example, each interval (along the x-axis), the height of the bar for this interval will represent the number of records (rows in our data) that have ENTRIESn_hourly that falls in this interval. Remember to increase the number of bins in the histogram (by having larger number of bars). The default bin width is not sufficient to capture the variability in the two samples.</p>

				<p class = "col-md-12 q32">3.2 One visualization can be more freeform. Some suggestions are:Ridership by time-of-day, Ridership by day-of-week</p>

						<li>This statistical test has been performed to answer question "What is the effect of Rain on the NYC Subway ridership?"</li>
						<li>Mann-Whitney U is a statistical test that quantifies the likelihood of a particular claim over the other. That's why it is also call Hypothesis testing.</li>
						<li>In Hypothesis testing we either retain or reject a NULL Hypothesis.</li>
						<li>NULL Hypothesis in this case is that there is no dependency of rain on ridership of NYC Subway.</li>
						<li>Results and Observations
							<ul>
								<li>The mean of ridership when it did not rain was calculated to be 1105.45</li>
								<li>The mean of ridership when it rained was calculated to be 1090.28</li>
								<li>The mean when it did not rain is higher than when it rained.</li>
								<li>In order to quantify this we performed Mann-Whitney U with a critical value of 0.05.</li>
								<li>The probability value of Mann-Whitney U after passing in these two data sets was calculated to be 0.025.</li>
								<li>Since the probability value calculated is well below the critical value we can conclude that higher value for the mean "<b>when no rain</b>"" did not occur by chance, but due to some kind of intervention. In this case rain.</li>

					<div class = "col-md-1"></div><p class = "col-md-11">This is a statistical model that is used for making predictions about an occurrence of an event based on a previous study that has occurred on an existing data set for which we have results. In this case we are trying to predict the NYC Subway ridership choice of New Yorkers taking into considerations some factors (atmospheric conditions in this case). The inputs that have been provided to this model are rain, precipitation, hour of the day and mean temperature. Below are the list inputs along with their corresponding Weights or Coefficients for this statistical model.</p>
					<div class = "col-md-2"></div>
					<ul class = "col-md-10">
						<li>Rain : 2.92398062e+00</li>
						<li>Precipitation : 1.46526720e+01</li>

					<div class = "col-md-1"></div><p class = "col-md-11">Weights or Coefficients for an input parameter determine effect it has on output variable. Higher the value of the coefficient stronger the relationship it has with the output parameter. Stronger the relationship the better it can be used to predict the output. These coefficients are calculated using the Gradient Descent algorithm.</p>

					<div class = "col-md-1"></div><p class = "col-md-11">Looking at the coefficient values for the above parameters Hour of the day or Time of the day seems to have strongest relationship to the output parameter "Subway Ridership". Second highest relationship seems to be with parameter "occurrence of rain".</p>

					<div class = "col-md-1"></div><p class = "col-md-11">After observing the above results from the both the Statistical tests it can be concluded that Occurrence of rain is definitely a contributing factor that determines NYC Subway Ridership.</p>

					<ul class = "col-md-10">
						<li>In my case of Linear Regression it may not be considered a perfect prediction model.</li>
						<li>It can be concluded by the fact that R2 (R-Squared) value was calculated to be 0.46.</li>
						<li>The causes might be is that relationship between the variables and output is not strong enough.</li>
						<li>The relationship of the input variable to output is indicated by the coefficient of the input variable.</li>
